## Behavioral Change

A **behavioral change** is a change defined by **change-driven acceptance criteria** — the new (or restored) behavior IS specified by the AC scenarios produced from the ticket. Stories (`atdd-story`, new behavior) and bugs (`atdd-bug`, restored behavior) are behavioral; their change-driven AC route to the **AT Cycle** (test-first / ATDD). The unit of work in the AT Cycle is the **ticket** — all change-driven scenarios for the ticket are batched through each phase together, with no per-scenario inner loop.

Note: a behavioral-change ticket may *also* include a Legacy Coverage section; that's orthogonal — see [Legacy Coverage](#legacy-coverage) below.

## Structural Change

A **structural change** is a change that produces **no change-driven acceptance criteria**. The three task subtypes (`atdd-task-system-api`, `atdd-task-system-ui`, `atdd-task-external-api`, each an interface change at a single system boundary) and chores (`atdd-chore`, internal-only change) are structural. Existing AC must stay green by construction. The structural change still flows through a cycle — each task subtype enters its dedicated cycle (the **System API Task Cycle**, **System UI Task Cycle**, or **External API Task Cycle**), and chores enter the **Chore Cycle** — but each cycle has no RED/GREEN per scenario; instead it consists of implementation, STOP - HUMAN REVIEW, COMMIT, and Acceptance Stage verify (the **Acceptance Stage** of the CI pipeline is the verifier that "existing AC must stay green"). All four structural cycles end by ticking the ticket's checklist of structural change items and, once all are ticked, moving the issue to DONE. The External API Task Cycle has no standalone STOP/COMMIT — those happen inside the Contract Test Sub-Process it wraps.

Note: a structural-change ticket may *also* include a Legacy Coverage section; that's orthogonal — see [Legacy Coverage](#legacy-coverage) below.

## Legacy Coverage

**Legacy Coverage** is orthogonal to behavioral/structural classification. It is a **section in the ticket schema**, optional on any ticket type (story, bug, system-api-task, system-ui-task, external-api-task, or chore). The section lists retroactive AC scenarios for previously uncovered functionality the change touches.

Legacy Coverage uses the **test-last** approach: tests are written retroactively for already-built behavior, and they should pass on first run because the behavior already exists. **This is NOT ATDD** — there is no Red → Green per scenario. A ticket whose schema carries a Legacy Coverage section routes through the **Legacy Coverage Cycle**, regardless of ticket type.

When a ticket carries both a change-driven payload (story/bug AC, or a structural change from any of the three task subtypes or a chore) *and* a Legacy Coverage section, the Legacy Coverage Cycle runs first, then the AT Cycle (if applicable) — fill the coverage gap before piling new behavior on top.

## Interface Change

An **interface change** is any modification to a public contract between layers. This includes:

- Adding, removing, or renaming interface methods
- Changing method signatures (parameters, return types)
- Adding, removing, or renaming fields in request or response DTOs associated with those methods

This definition applies uniformly to DSL port interfaces, Driver port interfaces, and external system interfaces.

In the intake-classification sense, an **interface change** is specifically a change at the **system boundary** — system API, system UI, or external system API. The three task subtypes (`atdd-task-system-api`, `atdd-task-system-ui`, `atdd-task-external-api`) each cover exactly one of these three boundaries. Driver *implementations* update to match the new interface; driver *interfaces* stay the same so existing acceptance tests still pass through them. Single-driver scope is enforced at ticket-creation time — multi-boundary work is split into multiple coordinated tickets.

**Why it matters for the ATDD pipeline:**
- A DSL interface change → update DSL port and implementation
- A Driver interface change → update driver port and adapters
- An external system interface change (any change under `driver-port/.../external/`) → triggers the contract test subprocess (see `contract-tests.md`)
- A System API change classified as `atdd-task-system-api` → routes to the **System API Task Cycle** (update System API Driver; STOP - HUMAN REVIEW → COMMIT → Pipeline - Acceptance Stage verify). Single-driver scope.
- A System UI change classified as `atdd-task-system-ui` → routes to the **System UI Task Cycle** (update System UI Driver; STOP - HUMAN REVIEW → COMMIT → Pipeline - Acceptance Stage verify). Single-driver scope.
- An External System API change classified as `atdd-task-external-api` → routes to the **External API Task Cycle**, which wraps the Contract Test Sub-Process (per-phase RED/GREEN inside CT, four-commit sequence; the External API Task Cycle itself has no standalone STOP/COMMIT). Single-driver scope.

For all three task subtypes, existing AC must stay green; driver bodies adapt to the new boundary interface, and the **Acceptance Stage** of the CI pipeline is the verifier. If the ticket additionally carries a Legacy Coverage section, the Legacy Coverage Cycle runs first.

## Internal-only Change

An **internal-only change** is a change inside the system that does not modify any boundary — no system API, system UI, or external system API change. Examples: refactor a class, rename, dependency upgrade. Drivers are untouched. Internal-only changes are classified as `atdd-chore`; they route to the **Chore Cycle** (Implement → STOP - HUMAN REVIEW → COMMIT → Pipeline - Acceptance Stage verify, with a fix-loop on red). Existing AC must stay green; the **Acceptance Stage** of the CI pipeline is the verifier. If the ticket additionally carries a Legacy Coverage section, the Legacy Coverage Cycle runs first.

## Legacy Coverage Cycle

The **Legacy Coverage Cycle** is the **test-last retroactive-AC cycle**. It is reachable from any ticket type (`atdd-story`, `atdd-bug`, `atdd-task-system-api`, `atdd-task-system-ui`, `atdd-task-external-api`, `atdd-chore`) whose ticket carries a [Legacy Coverage](#legacy-coverage) section. Because the behavior already exists, the retroactive acceptance tests written in this cycle should pass on first run; this is **not ATDD** (no Red → Green per scenario).

Task tickets enter the matching task cycle — `system-api-task` → **System API Task Cycle**, `system-ui-task` → **System UI Task Cycle**, `external-api-task` → **External API Task Cycle** — and chore tickets enter the **Chore Cycle**. All four are structural cycles with no RED/GREEN per scenario, governed by the rule that **existing AC must stay green** (the **Acceptance Stage** of the CI pipeline at the end of each cycle is the verifier). All four cycles' phases are now defined; see `orchestrator.md` and `process-diagram.md` for the full flows. The Legacy Coverage Cycle's own internal phases are TBD.

## `shop/` Package vs `shop` Repository

ATDD content uses the word **shop** in two distinct ways. They look similar but mean different things:

- **`shop/` (with trailing slash)** — a package/folder convention inside the testkit's driver layer (e.g. `driver-port/.../shop/api`, `driver-adapter/.../shop/ui`). This is the SUT-internal driver namespace, paired with `external/` (drivers for external systems). The name is part of ATDD doctrine and is **not** the repo name. Do not rename it.
- **`shop` (no slash, used in repo context)** — the repository name of the system under test. When `gh optivem atdd install` copies these prompts into a student repo, this gets substituted with the student's repo name. The `shop/` package convention stays unchanged.

The two uses are kept textually distinct (slash vs. no-slash) so the install-time substitution can target one without disturbing the other.
