# AT Cycle Conventions

## Suite Selection

Each acceptance test is annotated with a channel. Use the matching suite placeholder throughout all phases:
- `<acceptance-api>` — for tests annotated with `@Channel(API)`
- `<acceptance-ui>` — for tests annotated with `@Channel(UI)`

If a test covers both channels, run both suites.

## Commit Message Format

Every commit message follows the pattern: `<Ticket> | <Phase>`.

The unit of work in the AT Cycle is a **ticket**, not an individual scenario — all scenarios for the ticket are batched through each phase together (see `at-red-test.md`). Commit messages reflect the ticket title.

If a GitHub issue number was provided as input, prefix every commit message with `#<issue-number> | `. Example: `#42 | Register Customer | AT - RED - TEST`.

**Important:** The phase suffix in the message is the phase *prefix only* (e.g. `AT - RED - TEST`). Do **NOT** append `- COMMIT` or `- WRITE` to the phase in the commit message — those suffixes identify the section header only, not the commit message.
