# Prerequisites

Before starting the onboarding, gather the following information and prepare credentials.

## Project Information

1. **GitHub owner** — your GitHub username or organization name.
   - Check if it's a user or org (CLI):
     ```bash
     gh api users/<owner> --jq '.type'
     ```
2. **System domain** — the business domain for your project (e.g. Book Store, Flight Reservation, Task Planner).
   - Do NOT choose eShop (the instructor uses that as an example).
   - Avoid your company's actual domain for NDA compliance.
3. **System name** — a name for your system (e.g. ACME Shop, SkyBook).
4. **Repo name** — derived from system name by hyphenating and lowercasing (e.g. "ACME Shop" → `acme-shop`).
   - Optionally append a random suffix (e.g. `acme-shop-7f3a`) to guarantee uniqueness.
   - Check if it already exists (CLI):
     ```bash
     gh repo view <owner>/<repo> 2>&1
     ```
   - If it exists, you must choose a different name or add a random suffix.
5. **Monolith language** — Java, .NET, TypeScript, or Other.
6. **System test language** — same as monolith, or different (common when dev and QA teams use different languages).
7. **Architecture** — Monolith or multitier. If multitier, decide on the components (e.g. frontend, backend).
8. **Repository strategy** — Monorepo or multirepo. Multirepo only makes sense with multitier.

## Credentials

> **Note:** The credentials below will be set on your GitHub repository. You don't need the repository to exist yet — just have the credentials ready. You'll set them on the repository during [Setup](monolith/01-setup.md) after creating it.

### Docker Hub

1. Create a Docker Hub account at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com) if you don't have one (browser).
2. Create an access token at [Docker Hub Security Settings](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security) (browser).
3. Note your Docker Hub username and token — you'll set them on your repository in the Setup step.

### SonarCloud

1. Create a SonarCloud token — see [SonarCloud Setup](monolith/02a-sonarcloud-setup.md) (browser).
2. Note the token — you'll set it on your repository in the SonarCloud Setup step.

## Onboarding Mode

You can run the onboarding in one of two modes:

- **Interactive** — the onboarding guide agent will ask you for credentials and project details as needed. No extra setup required — just start the agent and follow the prompts.
- **Non-interactive** — set environment variables **before** launching your IDE or Claude Code so the agent can read them at runtime without prompting. This is useful if you want a hands-off experience or are running the onboarding tester agent.

If you choose **interactive mode**, skip to the [Checklist](#checklist) — you're ready to go.

### Environment Variables (non-interactive mode)

Set the following environment variables on your machine:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_SANDBOX_TESTER_TOKEN` | A GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope (optional if `gh` CLI is already authenticated via `gh auth login`) |
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Your Docker Hub username |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | Your Docker Hub access token |
| `SONAR_TOKEN` | Your SonarCloud token (can be deferred until SonarCloud Setup step) |

How to set them depends on your OS:

- **Windows** — add them as User environment variables via System Settings > Environment Variables, or in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DOCKERHUB_USERNAME", "your-username", "User")
  [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DOCKERHUB_TOKEN", "dckr_pat_...", "User")
  [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GITHUB_SANDBOX_TESTER_TOKEN", "ghp_...", "User")
  ```
- **macOS / Linux** — add `export` lines to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
  ```bash
  export DOCKERHUB_USERNAME="your-username"
  export DOCKERHUB_TOKEN="dckr_pat_..."
  export GITHUB_SANDBOX_TESTER_TOKEN="ghp_..."
  ```

After setting them, **restart any open terminals, IDEs, and CLI tools** — running processes do not pick up new environment variables automatically.

## Checklist

1. Project information is decided
2. Docker Hub account and access token are ready
3. SonarCloud token is ready (can be deferred until SonarCloud Setup step)
4. *(Non-interactive mode only)* Environment variables are set and IDE has been restarted
