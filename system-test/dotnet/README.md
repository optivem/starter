# System Test (C#/.NET)

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell 7+
- Docker Desktop (running)
- .NET SDK 8+

## Architectures

MyShop ships two architectures side-by-side. Each has its own compose files and
usage examples:

- [monolith/README.md](monolith/README.md) — single-service system
- [multitier/README.md](multitier/README.md) — frontend + backend + external simulators

The entry-point script `Run-SystemTests.ps1` accepts `-Architecture monolith|multitier`
and dot-sources the selected architecture's configuration from its subdirectory.
